When customers choose to participate in a CAPSTONE project they may elect for a private repository. There are many reasons why someone might choose to go this route, security being one reason. Some companies may work with private data and do not want the public to have access to the way this data is stored. Another reason could be that complex algorithms or other code blocks have been written and the customer does not want them to be public knowledge. It is also possible the company does not want outside coders or ‘just anybody’ working on their programs. Manly customers choose private repositories for a place to backup their code without it being out in the open.

Signal Private Messenger is an open-source messaging app. One might wonder why a CAPSTONE customer chooses private repos while companies like Signal choose public. Signal is a non-profit organization who chooses to allow the public to improve and optimize their application as well as customize it for their personal benefit. Most CAPSTONE customers are for profit organizations and will opt to make money in any way possible. If users can customize the CAPSTONE customers applications they may not pay the money for the initial product.
